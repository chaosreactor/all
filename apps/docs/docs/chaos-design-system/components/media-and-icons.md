# Media and Icons

## Icons
### Line
Line icons are largely sourced from the Lucide open source icon library. We created new icons where Lucide icons don't work or don't exist, and plan to contribute them back to the community.
### Emoji
We use the Noto Emoji which is an open source emoji project run by Google. We leverage the Noto Emoji Library community Figma file created by the Chaos Reactor CPO Lauren Golembiewski. 
## Logo
Logo images used to represent the Chaos Reactor brand as well as other brands we integrate with or link to.
## Loader
Created an inital loader with the LottieFiles plugin which has a lot of Lottie supported loaders that can be customized. I grabbed [one I thought would work well](https://lottiefiles.com/99084-circle-loader) until we have more time to tie in animation to the branding.
