# Media and Icons

## Icons
### Line
Line icons are largely sourced from the [Lucide open source icon library](https://github.com/lucide-icons/lucide). We created new icons where Lucide icons don't work or don't exist, and plan to contribute them back to the community.
### Emoji
We use [Noto Emoji](https://github.com/googlefonts/noto-emoji), an open source emoji project run by Google. In our designs, We leverage the [Noto Emoji Library community Figma file](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1162541361730712423) created by the Chaos Reactor CPO Lauren Golembiewski.
## Logo
Logo images used to represent the Chaos Reactor brand as well as other brands we integrate with or link to. We leverage the [Simple Icons project](https://simpleicons.org/) for other company logos.
## Loader
Created an initial loader with the LottieFiles plugin which has a lot of Lottie supported loaders that can be customized. I grabbed [one I thought would work well](https://lottiefiles.com/99084-circle-loader) until we have more time to tie in animation to the branding.
