3. Open it - 
4. First Screen - Welcome screen to orient users and describe how Chaos Reactor works. Could be a good oportunity to show a getting started video and link to our getting started docs. 
5. Setup AI providers - 
	1. Getting API keys
	2. Managing 3P accounts
6. Create first Reactor - template selection screen
