Chaos Reactor is a no-code desktop app for building AI workflows.

## Principles

- **Individual data ownershop** - People should own their data and have an easy way to manage it. Chaos Reactor users will have control over their data and content which is why the MVP is a local-first desktop app.
- **Community-driven** - Connecting people and ideas through community.
- **Approachable but deep** - Chaos Reactor should be easy to approach and start using, but have a depth of exploration that creates endless possibilities.
- **Make the technical easy to understand** - Break down technical concepts, remove jargon, and use visuals to best explain what's happening in the system.
